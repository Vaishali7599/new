    <H1>WHAT IS EXPERIENCE</H1>
    
        <P>Experience is knowledge or skill in a particular job or activity, which you have gained because you have done that job or activity for a long time.</P>
    <H2>IMAGINATIONS</H2>
    
        <P>
            Imagination is the production or simulation of novel objects, sensations, and ideas in the mind without any immediate input of the senses. Stefan Szczelkun characterises it as the forming of experiences in one's mind, which can be re-creations of past experiences, such as vivid memories with imagined changes, or completely invented and possibly fantastic scenes.

            <h3>thinking</h3> 
            
            <p>In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception.</p>
